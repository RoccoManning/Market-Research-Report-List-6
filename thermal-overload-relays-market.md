<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Overload Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset Thermal Overload Relays</li><li>Automatic Reset Thermal Overload Relays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal Overload Relays are used to protect electric motors from overheating and burning out. Two common types of Thermal Overload Relays are Manual Reset and Automatic Reset. Manual Reset relays require the user to manually reset the relay after a thermal overload occurs, providing a more hands-on approach to motor protection. Automatic Reset relays will automatically reset themselves after a thermal overload event, offering a more convenient and automated solution for motor protection. Both types are essential in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of electric motors.</p></p>
