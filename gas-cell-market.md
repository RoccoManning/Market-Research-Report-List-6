<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Cell Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Sealed</li><li>Vapor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas cell markets can be categorized into three main types: open, sealed, and vapor markets. In open gas cell markets, gases are free to flow in and out of the system, making them ideal for continuous sampling and analysis. Sealed gas cell markets, on the other hand, are designed to contain gases within a closed environment, ensuring no leakage or contamination. Vapor gas cell markets involve the use of liquids that evaporate into gas form for analysis, offering a unique approach to gas sampling and measurement.</p></p>
