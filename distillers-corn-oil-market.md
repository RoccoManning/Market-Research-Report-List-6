<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distillers Corn Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Milling</li><li>Wet-Milling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Distillers Corn Oil (DCO) market is primarily divided into two production types: dry-milling and wet-milling. In dry-milling, corn is ground into meal, with the starch converted into ethanol, resulting in co-products like DCO. This method tends to yield higher oil content. In contrast, wet-milling involves soaking corn to separate its components, allowing for greater extraction of various by-products, including oil. Both methods cater to distinct market needs, influencing DCO's availability and application in industries such as biodiesel and animal feed.</p></p>
