<p><h1>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Size: Growth Outlook from 2024 to 2031, projecting at Market's Trends Analysis by Application, Regional Outlook, and Revenue</h1></p><p><strong>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>The Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) is a technology used in vehicles to monitor tire pressure indirectly by utilizing existing wheel speed sensors. By measuring the rotation speed of each tire, the system can detect discrepancies that indicate under-inflation. This method is generally less expensive and simpler to implement than direct TPMS, which requires sensors in each tire.</p><p>The iTPMS market is experiencing significant growth, driven primarily by increasing safety regulations and rising consumer awareness regarding vehicle safety. The emphasis on fuel efficiency and environmental concerns is also propelling demand, as properly inflated tires contribute to better fuel economy. The automotive industryâ€™s shift towards advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is another contributing factor, integrating iTPMS for enhanced vehicle performance.</p><p>Latest trends include the integration of iTPMS with connected vehicle technologies, allowing real-time data sharing with mobile applications, which enhances user engagement and vehicle monitoring. Additionally, as electric and hybrid vehicles gain popularity, the need for innovative tire monitoring solutions is anticipated to rise. The Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.9% during the forecast period, reflecting its crucial role in modern automotive safety systems.</p></p>
