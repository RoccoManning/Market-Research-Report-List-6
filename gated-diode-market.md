<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gated Diode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>First Mode</li><li>Second Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gated diodes are classified into two main types based on their operating modes: First Mode and Second Mode. In First Mode, the diode is in a low impedance state when the gate voltage is below a certain threshold, and switches to a high impedance state when the gate voltage exceeds the threshold. Second Mode operates in the opposite way, where the diode is in a high impedance state below the threshold and switches to a low impedance state above it. These two modes offer flexibility for different applications in electronic circuits.</p></p>
