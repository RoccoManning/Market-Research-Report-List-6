<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insect Growth Regulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors</li><li>Juvenile Hormone Analogs & Mimics</li><li>Anti-juvenile Hormone Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are categorized into three main types: Chitin synthesis inhibitors impede the formation of chitin, crucial for exoskeleton development, thereby preventing larvae from maturing. Juvenile hormone analogs and mimics disrupt the normal development process by mimicking juvenile hormones, resulting in affected insects remaining in larval stages or exhibiting abnormal growth. Anti-juvenile hormone agents counteract these hormones, facilitating premature metamorphosis and reducing population growth. Together, these IGRs effectively manage pest populations with limited impact on non-target species.</p></p>
