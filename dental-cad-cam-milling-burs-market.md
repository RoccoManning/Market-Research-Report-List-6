<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental CAD CAM Milling Burs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Burs</li><li>Non-Coated Burs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental CAD CAM milling burs are classified into two main types: Coated Burs and Non-Coated Burs. Coated burs have a special coating on the cutting surface which helps in reducing friction and heat during the milling process, improving overall efficiency and longevity of the bur. On the other hand, non-coated burs do not have this additional coating but are still effective in milling dental materials. Both types of burs play a crucial role in the dental CAD CAM milling process, catering to different needs and preferences of dental professionals.</p></p>
