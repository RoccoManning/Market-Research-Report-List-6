<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Video Choledochoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Choledochoscope</li><li>Flexible Choledochoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Video choledochoscopes are minimally invasive instruments used for visualizing the bile ducts during medical procedures. There are two main types of video choledochoscopes: rigid choledochoscopes and flexible choledochoscopes. Rigid choledochoscopes have a straight, inflexible design, making them ideal for navigating through straighter sections of the bile duct. Flexible choledochoscopes have a more maneuverable, bendable design, allowing them to navigate through more curved and narrow sections of the bile duct. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating bile duct disorders.</p></p>
