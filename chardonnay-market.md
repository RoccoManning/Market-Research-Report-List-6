<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chardonnay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oaked</li><li>Unoaked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chardonnay comes in two main market types: oaked and unoaked. Oaked Chardonnay is aged in oak barrels, giving it a rich, creamy texture with notes of vanilla, butter, and spice. This style is popular among those who enjoy a fuller-bodied wine with a hint of toasty oak. On the other hand, unoaked Chardonnay skips the oak aging process, resulting in a crisper, fruit-forward wine with notes of citrus, apple, and pear. This style appeals to those who prefer a lighter, more refreshing wine.</p></p>
