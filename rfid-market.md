<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive RFID</li><li>Active RFID</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID technology has two main market types: passive RFID and active RFID. Passive RFID systems rely on tags that do not have a power source of their own and rely on the energy emitted by RFID readers to transmit data. This makes them more cost-effective for large-scale applications but with shorter read ranges. Active RFID systems, on the other hand, use tags with their own power source and can transmit data over longer distances. This makes them suitable for tracking high-value assets or monitoring movement in real-time.</p></p>
