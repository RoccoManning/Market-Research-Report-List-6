<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glass market is categorized into two primary types: hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings. Hydrophilic coatings attract water, allowing dirt and grime to be washed away easily with rain, making surfaces cleaner. In contrast, hydrophobic coatings repel water, preventing droplets from adhering and causing dirt to slide off when the glass is tilted. Both types enhance maintenance efficiency, improve visibility, and extend the lifespan of glass surfaces, making them popular in architectural and automotive applications.</p></p>
