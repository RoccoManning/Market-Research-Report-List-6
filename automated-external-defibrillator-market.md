<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) market is categorized mainly into semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated AEDs guide users through voice prompts and require the responder to deliver the shock by pressing a button after analysis. In contrast, fully automated AEDs independently assess the heart rhythm and automatically deliver the shock without user intervention. This distinction enhances accessibility and usability, making both types vital for emergency response in various settings like public places, schools, and workplaces.</p></p>
