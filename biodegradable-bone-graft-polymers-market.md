<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Bone Graft Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Polymers</li><li>Natural Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biodegradable Bone Graft Polymers are categorized into two main types: Synthetic Polymers and Natural Polymers. Synthetic polymers are man-made materials that mimic the properties of natural bone, such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA). Natural polymers, on the other hand, are derived from plant or animal sources, such as collagen and chitosan. Both types of polymers are used in bone grafting procedures to promote bone regeneration and eventually degrade within the body, eliminating the need for a second surgery for removal.</p></p>
