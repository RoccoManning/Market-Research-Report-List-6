<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Fiber Amplifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lumped</li><li>Distributed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raman fiber amplifiers can be classified into two main types: lumped and distributed. Lumped amplifiers use discrete amplification at specific points along the fiber, while distributed amplifiers provide continuous amplification throughout the length of the fiber. Lumped amplifiers are simpler and more cost-effective, but distributed amplifiers offer higher gain and improved signal quality over longer distances. The choice between lumped and distributed amplifiers depends on the specific requirements of the system in terms of performance, cost, and distance.</p></p>
